# Project Description
This project implements a custom Max Heap data structure in Java, where each parent node has 2^x children. The heap is designed to perform insert and pop max operations with optimized performance.

## Features
Max-Heap Property: Every parent node must be greater than or equal to its children.
Variable Number of Children: Each parent node has 2^x children, where x is a parameter passed to the heap's constructor.
Efficient Performance: The insert and pop max operations are optimized to run in O(log n) time complexity.
Implemented in Java: The data structure uses an ArrayList for efficient memory management.
